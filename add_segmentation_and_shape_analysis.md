# Segmentation and Shape Analysis in Object Recognition

This document explains how our project addresses the requirement to show the **shape** of objects in video sequences, and why this is important for the analysis.

## What is Segmentation?

Object segmentation is a computer vision task that involves dividing an image into multiple segments or regions that correspond to different objects or parts of the image. Unlike object detection that only provides rectangular bounding boxes, segmentation provides a pixel-level understanding of the object's shape.

## Benefits of Shape Information

Understanding object shape through segmentation provides several benefits:

1. **Precise object boundaries**: Segmentation masks follow the actual contour of the object, rather than enclosing it in a rectangle.
2. **Better object separation**: When objects overlap, segmentation can distinguish between them more effectively.
3. **Depth perception**: Shape often provides clues about the 3D structure of objects.
4. **Detailed analysis**: Shape information supports more sophisticated analysis, such as posture recognition or parts identification.

## Implementation in Our Project

Our project implements shape recognition through the YOLOv8-Seg model, which performs both object detection (position) and instance segmentation (shape).

### Technical Implementation

1. **Visualization**: The segmentation masks are drawn on the video frames, showing precise object boundaries.
2. **Evaluation**: We evaluate segmentation quality using the COCO mAP metrics for segmentation.
3. **Comparison**: We compare the segmentation-capable model (YOLO-Seg) with traditional bounding box models.

### Practical Applications

Shape-based object recognition is critical for many real-world applications:

- **Autonomous vehicles**: Understanding the precise shape of obstacles for better path planning
- **Medical imaging**: Identifying irregularities in organ shapes
- **Industrial inspection**: Detecting defects in manufactured parts
- **Security systems**: More accurate human pose estimation and activity recognition

## Sample Results

For sample frames showing segmentation in action, see the output videos and sample frames in the `inference/output_videos/samples` directory. These examples demonstrate how shapes are recognized and visualized on different video sequences.

## Conclusion

By incorporating segmentation into our object recognition system, we fulfill the requirement to show not just the position (where) and class (what) of objects, but also their precise shape (how they look), providing a more complete understanding of the video content.
