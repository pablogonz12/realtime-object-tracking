# Project Overview
This project implements a computer vision system for detecting and segmenting objects in videos and images. The system evaluates multiple state-of-the-art object detection and segmentation algorithms on the COCO dataset, analyzing their performance for validity, reliability, and objectivity.

## Dataset Justification
The COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset was chosen as a representative dataset for this project due to its:
- **Diversity**: Contains 80 common object categories covering a wide range of everyday scenarios
- **Scale**: Includes over 200,000 labeled images with more than 1.5 million object instances
- **Complexity**: Features objects in their natural contexts with varying scales, occlusions, and viewpoints
- **Industry Standard**: Widely used benchmark in computer vision research, enabling direct comparison with state-of-the-art methods
- **Transferability**: Performance on COCO generally translates well to real-world video applications, making it ideal for our object recognition task

## Key Features
- Object detection and segmentation in videos
- Performance evaluation of multiple models
- Reliable command-line interfaces for automation and scripting (recommended)
- Comprehensive metrics dashboard
- Interactive GUI for visualization and analysis (alpha state, not recommended for evaluation)
