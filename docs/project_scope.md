# Project Scope: Real-time Object Detection & Segmentation System (Updated)

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for a computer vision system that detects, segments, and labels objects in video sequences. The system will utilize a **hybrid Python-Rust approach** where Python handles the machine learning components and Rust provides the GUI application layer. The final deliverable will be packaged as a standalone executable (.exe) that encapsulates both environments.

## Project Requirements

-   Process video input and output annotated video showing objects' positions, shapes, and names
-   Implement and evaluate three State-of-the-Art (SoA) object detection/segmentation algorithms
-   Evaluate approaches based on validity, reliability, and objectivity metrics
-   Package everything into a single, dependency-free executable file

## Technical Approach Selection

After evaluating multiple implementation strategies, we have selected a **Python-Rust hybrid architecture** for the following reasons:

-   **Leverages Python's ML ecosystem** for implementing complex computer vision models
-   **Utilizes Rust's performance benefits** for the user interface and video processing pipeline
-   **Balances development speed** with runtime performance requirements
-   **Enables access to official model implementations** without conversion complications

## SoA Approaches Selection

We will implement and compare these three state-of-the-art approaches:

### YOLOv12

Ultralytics' cutting-edge iteration offering real-time object detection and instance segmentation with improved accuracy and speed

-   **Strengths**: Enhanced inference speeds, superior accuracy over previous versions, advanced segmentation capabilities
-   **Implementation**: Ultralytics Python package (latest version)

### RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformer)

Transformer-based detector offering excellent accuracy with real-time performance

-   **Strengths**: Transformer architecture benefits, better handling of small objects, competitive speed-accuracy tradeoff
-   **Implementation**: Official implementation (Python)

### Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)

Meta AI's updated foundation model for image segmentation

-   **Strengths**: Enhanced zero-shot segmentation capabilities, improved memory mechanism, better occlusion handling
-   **Implementation**: Latest SAM2 implementation (Python)

## Dataset Selection

We will use the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset for evaluation as it:

-   Contains 80+ object categories
-   Provides instance segmentation annotations
-   Is widely used for benchmarking object detection systems
-   Has well-established evaluation metrics

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Python Components Development

-   Set up Python environment with PyTorch and required ML frameworks
-   Implement all three model approaches (YOLOv12, RT-DETR, SAM2)
-   Create unified inference pipeline for processing video frames
-   Implement evaluation metrics (mAP, IoU, FPS)
-   Establish Python API endpoints for Rust integration


### Phase 2: Rust Application Development

-   Design and implement GUI using egui framework
-   Create video processing pipeline in Rust
-   Implement configuration options for model selection
-   Develop visualization tools for detection results

### Phase 3: Python-Rust Integration

-   Utilize PyO3 framework to create bidirectional bindings
-   Implement error handling across language boundaries
-   Optimize memory usage for video processing
-   Create efficient frame passing mechanism between languages

### Phase 4: Executable Packaging

-   Use PyInstaller to bundle Python dependencies and models
-   Integrate with Rust build system (Cargo)
-   Develop custom build script combining both environments
-   Package all resources (models, configurations) into the executable
-   Test deployment on clean systems

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Python-Rust Integration

-   **Challenge**: Bidirectional communication between Rust and Python
-   **Solution**: Use PyO3 for Rust calling Python and pyo3-native for Python calling Rust functions
-   **Implementation Details**: Create a well-defined API boundary with clear data exchange formats

### Model Packaging

-   **Challenge**: Machine learning models can be large (500MB+)
-   **Solution**: Implement model download on first use, or make separate packages for each model
-   **Implementation Details**: Use a model registry system to manage downloads and caching

### Executable Packaging

-   **Challenge**: Combining Python and Rust into a single executable
-   **Solution**: Use custom build script combining PyInstaller output with Rust binary
-   **Implementation Details**: Create a multi-stage build process with clear dependency management

## Evaluation Plan

-   **Validity**: Calculate mAP, precision, recall on COCO validation set
-   **Reliability**: Test on varied video conditions (lighting, motion, occlusion)
-   **Objectivity**: Compare results across different object categories and sizes
-   **Performance**: Measure FPS and memory usage on standard hardware configurations

## Timeline & Milestones

-   **Week 1-2**: Python models implementation and testing
-   **Week 3-4**: Rust GUI development and initial integration with Python
-   **Week 5-6**: Full system integration and packaging solution development
-   **Week 7-8**: Evaluation, optimization and final packaging

## Considered Alternatives

While we've selected the Python-Rust hybrid approach, we also considered these alternatives:

### Pure Rust Implementation

-   **Advantages**: Better performance, easier packaging, no language integration issues
-   **Disadvantages**: Limited ML ecosystem, difficult implementation of cutting-edge models
-   **Why Not Selected**: Development timeline constraints and lack of official implementations

### Web-Based Application

-   **Advantages**: Cross-platform compatibility, modern UI development
-   **Disadvantages**: Network dependency, performance limitations, complex architecture
-   **Why Not Selected**: Requirement for standalone executable and performance considerations

## Conclusion

This project will deliver a standalone application using a Python-Rust hybrid architecture that demonstrates three state-of-the-art object detection and segmentation approaches. This approach optimally balances development efficiency with runtime performance. The final deliverable will be a single executable file that users can run without installing additional dependencies, along with an evaluation report and demonstration video.
